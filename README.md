Your current README is well-written but, as you mentioned, it feels overly formal and tailored for a job-seeking student. Let’s streamline it to make it more concise, professional, and reflective of your personality while still showcasing your skills and interests. Here's a revised version:

### **Key Changes Made**:  
1. **Removed Overly Formal Language**: Simplified the tone to make it more approachable and professional.  
2. **Condensed the Tech Stack**: Grouped similar tools together for better readability.  
3. **Added a Projects Section**: Highlighted your work to show impact rather than just listing skills.  
4. **Personalized Interests**: Made the interests section more engaging and relatable.  
5. **Removed Redundant Phrases**: Eliminated unnecessary fluff (e.g., “embracing the world of coding and innovation”).  

This version is cleaner, more professional, and focuses on showcasing your skills and personality without feeling like a resume. Let me know if you’d like further tweaks! 😊
